## Technical Projects

### FBG Interrogator
**C#/.NET + C/FreeRTOS** — *Proximion AB*

Engineered a ∼$500 prototype that matched performance of $10k+ industrial systems. Collaborated in a 6-person cross-functional team as one of the primary developers for the firmware and PC-host layers and built a preemptive multithreaded system (FreeRTOS/RISC-V) to synchronize high-priority ISRs with data processing. Developed C#/.NET host with a custom USB transfer protocol for sub-ms sensor readout and visualization. Built a self-hosted Linux CI/CD pipeline using hermetic Docker containers to enforce linting, formatting, and build validation.

*Closed Source (Industry R&D)*

### Sales Catalog Generator
**Java/JavaFX** — *Sevan AB*

Developed a cross-platform desktop application using JavaFX/AtlantaFX, enabling unified deployment across Windows, Linux, and macOS. Built an ETL pipeline to ingest CSV datasets and render print-ready PDFs programmatically. Replaced manual design workflows, reducing production time from hours to <3 minutes.

*Coming soon, currently being re-written*

### B2B Scan-to-Order
**Android / Kotlin** — *Sevan AB*

Architected a fault-tolerant Android application using Kotlin Coroutines for structured concurrency. Engineered a distributed data synchronization engine with automatic failover strategies (Firestore/REST). Integrated Google ML Kit for on-device barcode inference to enable scanning in low-connectivity environments.
